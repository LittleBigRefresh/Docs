# Tags/Labels Metadata for LittleBigPlanet

## Information

This is a list of labels/tags that can be applied to a level for each game.

I'm not sure the difference/purpose of what tags are from labels. They were removed in LBP3, which is why they are not present.

These were extracted from the EBOOT.bin file from each game.
