# Welcome to LittleBigRefresh!

LittleBigRefresh is intended to be a chill environment for people to discuss LittleBigPlanet, its community, its servers, or anything else LBP.

This is also the place for discussing the development of Refresh, a custom server for LittleBigPlanet.

# Rules

Our rules are simple. This can be summarized to "don't be an a-hole" or "use common sense" but to appease the Discord gods here are the basics:

1. Follow Discord's terms of service. These can be found at <https://discord.com/terms>.

2. No spam or self-promotion (server invites, advertisements, etc) without permission from a staff member. This includes DMing fellow members.

3. Treat everyone with respect. Absolutely no harassment, witch hunting, sexism, racism, or hate speech will be tolerated.

4. No age-restricted or obscene content. This includes text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content.
