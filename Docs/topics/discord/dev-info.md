# Welcome to the Refresh Development section!

Here you can find discussions between developers working on Refresh and its other projects such as Bunkum and Spycrab.

You're welcome to contribute to these discussions even if you aren't a developer, but just try to keep discussion focused and on-topic.

In general, you should avoid privately messaging developers to keep all discussions documented and in one place.

## Security

If you're here to report a security vulnerability, Discord isn't the best place.

Instead, you should use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature - this is enabled on all of our projects under the security tab.

For Refresh, this is accessible at <https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/Refresh/security>.
