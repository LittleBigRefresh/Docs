       title="Refresh APIv3 Bindings" id="refresh-apiv3-bindings">

    <p>
        Refresh's API is intended to be accessible and used by anyone.
        To facilitate this, here's a set of bindings we've created for a couple of languages,
        as well as some information on how to create your own.
    </p>

    <chapter title="Creating your own bindings" id="creating-your-own-bindings">
        <p>
            If you would like to roll your own solution to your bindings, we have some helpful tools available.
            Obviously, we're open source, so you can just look at the code, but we do care about proper documentation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Past that, though, we automatically generate API documentation at runtime and serve that over the API.
            You can view that in a browser on our production instance <a href="https://lbp.lbpbonsai.com/documentation">here</a> if you would like,
            but the documentation is also exposed on every Refresh server's API via <code>/api/v3/documentation</code>.
        </p>

        <warning>
            <p>
                Refresh's API is subject to change as development progresses, but we try to avoid breaking changes where we can.
                It's best to keep an eye on development, so you know what's coming.
            </p>

            <p>
                In addition, we're still working on bringing you some docs regarding types, so for now you'll have to manually peek at requests.
            </p>
        </warning>

                The gold standard for an API client right now is <a href="https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/refresh-web">refresh-web (written in Angular/TypeScript)</a>.
                If you're ever confused about anything, feel free to peek at that project's source code.
